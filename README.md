# test-repo
```
實際使用 GitHub Flow 來進行練習

step:
1. fork a project from source repo to personal repo
2. clone to local storage
3. add a remote url (source repo)
3. create a feature branch from main/master branch & edit
4. push feature branch to personal repo
5. create pull request(PR) to source repo
6. wait merge by repo maintainer
7. sync repo between source and personal (pull from source,push to personal)
```
